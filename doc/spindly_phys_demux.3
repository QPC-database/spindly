.SH NAME
spindly_phys_demux - demultiplex data from the physical connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <spindly.h>

spindly_error_t spindly_phys_demux(struct spindly_phys *phys,
                                   struct spindly_demux *message);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
When data from the single physical connection has been passed into spindly, it
needs to demux the data. It means it will split it up into separate messages
and separate channels and then hand it out as individual messages.

\fIspindly_phys_demux(3)\fP returns information about the first incoming
messages on the connection, separated for consumption accordingly. Subsequent
calls will return the next result and so on until there's nothing left to
demux - until \fIspindly_phys_incoming(3)\fP is called again to feed it with
more data. When it returns with no more message, it may still hold trailing
data that forms the beginning of the subsequent message.

When a piece of data passed in with \fIspindly_phys_incoming(3)\fP has been
fully handled (which it needs to be even if the trailing part isn't a complete
packet/frame), the CONFIG->demuxed callback must be called (if set with
\fIspindly_phys_init(3)\fP).

When \fIspindly_phys_demux(3)\fP is called, do note that if you pass in the
same struct_demux pointer as in the previous invoke, spindly will overwrite
the old data.

\fBphys\fP is a pointer to the handle returned by \fIspindly_phys_init(3)\fP

\fBmessage\fP is a pointer to a spindly_demux struct.

If this function returns SPINDLYE_OK, the spindly_demux struct's 'type' field
will be filled with information about which kind of message that was
retrieved. Depending on the type, the corresponding union struct has been
provided:
.IP SPINDLY_DX_NONE
No message
.IP SPINDLY_DX_GOAWAY
No data provided
.IP SPINDLY_DX_STREAM_ACK
The 'stream' struct has been filled in
.IP SPINDLY_DX_STREAM_REQ
The 'stream' struct has been filled in
.IP SPINDLY_DX_STREAM_KILL
The 'stream' struct has been filled in
.IP SPINDLY_DX_SETTINGS
The 'settings' struct has been filled in
.IP SPINDLY_DX_PING
No data provided
.IP SPINDLY_DX_DATA
The 'data' struct has been filled in
.IP SPINDLY_DX_HEADERS
The 'headers' struct has been filled in
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a spindly_error_t error code. See \fIspindly-errors(3)\fP.
