 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Libspdy is a C implementation of Googles SPDY protocol. It's main goals are:
 *  - Completely implementing the SPDY protocol stanard.
 *  - Being lightweight: As few dependencies as possible.
 *  - High testcoverage: Every function and branch should be tested.
 *   - Unittests using Check
 *   - Coverage check using LCOV
 *  - Good documentation: The API documentation itself and the code should be as documented as possible - without cluttering the source.
