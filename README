I've imported the libspdy git repository as a foundation for further work and
research. My goal is to create a good, solid and portable C89 library to do
SPDY transfers. I've not been able to establish contact with libspdy's author.

I'm not satisfied with the current API but as the code seems to do SPDY
transfers already it should be a decent base to start with.

I've already converted the code to be C89 compliant and next I'll work on
improving the API and then writing test cases to work against an existing
(separate) SPDY server implementation.

I've used a different name already to make it distinctly clear that I do not
intend to stay with many of the original libspdy concepts/designs.

I welcome help, suggestions and ideas from fellow hackers. Speak up and we'll
start a mailing list and whatever to get going.

The original README follows below:
