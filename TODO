Here's a list of things to work on. Not necessarily in this order. And there
are things not included here we can do as well!

*  Communication with Thomas Roth (primary author of libspdy) was established
   but hasn't worked. Ideally we'll work out a way in which we can work
   forward in a way that will allow Thomas' team to join in and we can merge
   our efforts at a later point.

*  setup an initial site for this effort (possibly a wiki on github will
   suffice for a good while)

1. jot up a modified API, some important details:

   A - keep internal data/structs private and hidden from the apps
   B - support both ends of SPDY connections eually fine

2. write up two test applications that use the new API, one client and
   one server

3. establish and make use of new source indentation setup and style,
   - convert typedef'ed struct back to real structs
   - change _Bool to something nicer

4. implement the new API and document it in man pages

5. Try it out in some early real-world application use cases (like libcurl) to
   see that it also works in reality

6. make test cases for the new API

7. introduce autoconf + automake

8. create a public spindly.h header in a separate include/ directory
