*  Communication with Thomas Roth (primary author of libspdy) has been
   established. I'll coordinate with him/them to see if I plan of actions
   needs to be altered...

*  As soon as a few more intersted souls pop in, start a mailing list
   and setup an initial site for this library.

1. jot up a modified API, some important details:

   A - keep internal data/structs private and hidden from the apps
   B - support both ends of SPDY connections eually fine

2. write up two test applications that use the new API, one client and
   one server

3. establish and make use of new source indentation setup and style,
   - convert typedef'ed struct back to real structs
   - change _Bool to something nicer

4. implement the new API and document it in man pages

5. make test cases for the new API

6. introduce autoconf + automake

7. create a public spindly.h header in a separate include/ directory
